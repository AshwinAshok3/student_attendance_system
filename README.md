# 🔒 Sentinel AI: Offline Facial Recognition System
**GPU-Accelerated | Privacy-First | 100% Local Execution**

A production-ready attendance system that runs entirely offline. It uses **InsightFace (State-of-the-Art)** for recognition and operates exclusively on **NVIDIA GPUs** for real-time performance.

## ⚡ Key Features
- **Zero Internet Needed:** Runs completely offline after initial setup.
- **Portable Architecture:** Comes with its own isolated Python environment (doesn't mess up your system).
- **Auto-Sync:** Just drop student photos into `data/students/` and the system learns them automatically on startup.
- **Anti-Spoofing Logic:** Prevents registration if multiple unknown faces are present.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites (READ CAREFULLY)
To run this system, your computer **MUST** have:
1.  **OS:** Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit).
2.  **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or higher.
3.  **Driver:** Latest NVIDIA GPU Driver installed.

> ❌ **WARNING:** This system will REFUSE to run on CPU. An NVIDIA GPU is mandatory.

## 🚀 Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Sentinel-AI.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Sentinel-AI.git)
cd Sentinel-AI
```

### Step 2: Run the One-Click Installer
This script will download a standalone Python environment and all 3GB of GPU libraries into the project folder. It does NOT require admin privileges.

1. Right-click `install_local.ps1`.

2. Select **"Run with PowerShell"**.

3. *Alternative*: Open PowerShell in the folder and run:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install_local.ps1
```
4. Wait until you see the message: `✅ SETUP COMPLETE!` (This takes 5-10 minutes depending on internet speed).   


### 1. Add Student Data (Optional)
The system learns faces automatically.

1. Go to the `data/students` folder.

2. Create a folder for each student (e.g., `data/students/John_Doe`).

3. Paste 1 or 2 clear photos of their face inside that folder.


### 2. Launch the System
Run `.\start_app.bat` file from **powershell**.

* **First Run**: You will see a black window downloading the AI models (approx 300MB). **Do not close it**.

* Subsequent Runs: The system will launch instantly and open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`.


### Troubleshooting
Q: The black window closes immediately! 

You likely don't have an NVIDIA GPU or your drivers are old. Update your NVIDIA drivers.

Q: "Execution Policy" Error during install? A: Run this command in PowerShell first: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Q: Where is the data stored? A:

* Photos: `data/students/`

* Logs: `database/attendance.db` (SQLite)

* Encodings: `database/embeddings.pkl`

### 💡 IMPORTANT: my GitHub?
You must **NOT** upload the huge files generated by your installer.

**1. Your `.gitignore` is already set up to block:**
* `python_bin/` (The huge portable Python folder)
* `ai_models/` (The downloaded weights)
* `*.onnx` (Large model files)

**2. What actually goes to GitHub:**
When you push your code, only these lightweight files will be uploaded (approx 200KB total):
* `app.py`
* `face_engine.py`
* `install_local.ps1`
* `start_app.bat`
* `requirements.txt`
* `frontend/styles.css`
* `utils/gpu_check.py`

**3. The Experience for the Other Person:**
They download these tiny scripts → Run `install_local.ps1` → The script recreates the huge 3GB environment on **their** computer automatically. That is the magic of this architecture.
